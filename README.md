## Abstract

A lot of the hard important work that goes into good data work is invisible.
For example, most of an exploratory data analysis 
is testing *and discarding* hypotheses.
We explore complex data so we can distill our findings into a simple narrative.
We never talk about all the hypotheses we’ve discarded!
If we’re doing it right, we make our work look simple.
This is super valuable, 
but can cause problems when we try to demonstrate our value.
This talk covers some strategies for 
getting credit for this super valuable but invisible work.
