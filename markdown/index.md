Hey, y'all. I'm Ryan.
I'm a data scientist at Mozilla (you probably know Firefox).
I blog fairly regularly - there's a link to my blog.

I'm here to talk about Invisible Work, and
I'll jump right in since our time is short.

# What is "Invisible Work"?

* For this talk, work that:
  * Is critical to success
  * Takes skill to do well
  * Isn't shown to stakeholders

???

To start - what _is_ invisible work?

I'm using a very particular definition for this talk.
It's work that is critical to success,
doesn't get presented to your stakeholder,
and takes skill to do well.

---

# Invisible _Data_ Work 

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Cleaning
* User Interviews
* Stakeholder Management

???

Invisible work shows up everywhere,
but it's particularly prominent in Data Science.

This class of work dominates the time to produce good work.
But, most of the time this work doesn't get shared with anyone but the analyst.

# The DS Process

Graphic: ? -> squiggles -> !

Squiggles are rising spring shape?
Spring shape _then_ squiggles

???

My rough view of how data science works:

* We have some question we want to inform with data
* We go explore the data: 
  * generate hypotheses,
  * manipulate data,
  * evaluate guess
* Accruing context the whole time
* Eventually we satisfy ourselves, summarize our work, and deliver

# What our stakeholders see:

No.

This is good! Nobody want's complexity.
The DS is providing a valuable service by exploring and summarizing the data.

If I'm doing it right, I'm making my work look simple.

*But*, this can lead to problems when trying to demonstrate our value.

---

# Symptoms

* "Want to see you demonstrate more complexity in your work"
* Need to work on your throughput...
* Apparent pressure to use ML
* Long and boring reports

???

So what does this look like in practice?

It could look like having difficulty when going for promotion.
I personally have gotten this feedback on a performance review üòê (long ago).

But this type of backwards reasoning happens pretty often.
We conflate complex solutions with complex problems.
Complex work is a cost to be born, not a metric to increase.

Sometimes this encourages ICs to shoe-horn 
machine learning into places it doesn't belong.
More often, this leads to overly-complex and boring-to-read reports
that document every detail of an analysis.
These are both bad for different reasons.

In my experience, this tends to be a problem 
at more junior parts of the job ladder.

While we can try to not to succumb to these pressures, 
**incentives are powerful things**.

# So... What do I do?

* Build a narrative for your work
  * Focus on outcomes
* Arm your manager
* Fight recency bias

???

So... what do I do?

And I guess, idk.
There's no silver bullet for this problem, 
but I can share the strategies that worked well for me.

My hope is that framing this problem well
gets you 90% of the way there.
Having a well-stated problem is a big part of being successful.

---

# Build a Narrative

* Same work, two presentations
* Focus on what was actually **hard** about the work,
  (not just what was technically complex)
* Focus on what **outcomes** you created
* Don't share the complexity - nobody wants that

---

# Arm your manager

* Slip your story to your manager in 1:1s - repetition helps
* Everyone's busy. They'll be grateful to you for making it easy
* Sharing early gives you opportunities to redirect

---

# Fight Recency Bias

* We remember what's recent. The *solution* is the most recent
* We forget:
  * What state we were in at the beginning of this work
  * How difficult it was to choose a direction
  * All the stuff we decided *not* to do

---

# Yeah, but what do I _do_

* Snippets
* Quarterly Goals
* Brag Doc

We're still learning how to do DS well at scale,
and that leads to a lot of confusion about what work is important.
I think SWE went through a similar overhaul in the 90's,
where businesses learned how to work with programmers productively.
